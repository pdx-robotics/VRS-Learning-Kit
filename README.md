This is a learning kit developed by Michael Nguyen. It is intended to train Viking Robotics
Society (VRS) students in the mechanical and electrical assembly of robots. This project was initially
Michael Nguyen's first entry to his professional portfolio, but the president at the time, Anthony
Bruno, suggested that it should be utilized as a learning kit for VRS students as well.
